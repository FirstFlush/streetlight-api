# Streetlight API

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)  
> This repo is in active early-stage development. Expect bugs, breakage, and rapid iteration.

**Streetlight API** is the public infrastructure layer of the Street Ninja ecosystem ‚Äî a clean, standards-based API for exposing real-time resource data to support homeless and low-income individuals in Vancouver.

The goal is to make Streetlight API the most accurate and up-to-date source of crisis resources available, built not just for Street Ninja, but for any nonprofit, outreach team, or civic tech project that wants to help.

This app is responsible for:

- Scheduling scraping jobs (HTML, PDF, API)
- Passing raw content to the Python-powered [Ninja Crawl](https://github.com/FirstFlush/ninja_crawl) scraping engine
- Validating, normalizing, and storing structured resource data (shelters, meals, hygiene, etc.)
- Exposing a clean, public-facing API


## üîó Architecture

Streetlight API delegates all parsing logic to [**Ninja Crawl**](https://github.com/FirstFlush/ninja_crawl), a standalone Python FastAPI service. This app never scrapes HTML or PDFs directly ‚Äî instead, it handles orchestration:

1. Fetches raw content (using Axios, Playwright, or external APIs)
2. Sends raw data to Ninja Crawl (`POST /scrape`)
3. Validates the response using Zod schemas
4. Saves the result to PostgreSQL via Prisma


## üß± Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict)
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
- **Scraping Queue**: BullMQ (Redis-backed jobs)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Scheduling**: `@nestjs/schedule`
- **Logging**: Pino
- **Testing**: Jest


## üîç Know a Data Source?

Know of a website, PDF, or open data portal that lists services for unhoused or low-income people in BC?

Please reach out. I‚Äôm always looking to expand the dataset that powers Street Ninja.
