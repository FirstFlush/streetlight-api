# ninja-crawl

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge) 
>this repo is in active early-stage development. Expect bugs, breakage, and rapid iteration.

**ninja-crawl** is a NestJS-powered scraping framework built to collect, normalize, and store data relevant to low-income and homeless individuals across the Lower Mainland (BC, Canada). The goal is to build the most comprehensive, real-time database of resources available to someone in crisis ‚Äî including food programs, shelter availability, hygiene services, public internet, and more.

This project will aggregate data from a wide variety of sources:
- Public websites (via HTML scraping)
- PDF documents (using PDF parsers)
- Open APIs (from municipal, nonprofit, and health organizations)

All harvested data is funneled into a clean, unified format and stored in a PostgreSQL database. From there, it can be exposed via API to support projects like [Street Ninja](https://streetninja.ca) and other community-led initiatives.

## üí° Know a Data Source?

If you‚Äôre aware of a public website, PDF, API, or any source of useful information for homeless or low-income individuals in BC ‚Äî please reach out.

I'm always looking for new data to scrape, parse, and include in the Street Ninja resource network.

Open an issue, start a discussion, or [email me](mailto:firstflush@protonmail.com). Let's make this dataset better together.
