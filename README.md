>this repo is in active early-stage development. Expect bugs, breakage, and rapid iteration.

**ninja-crawl** is a NestJS-powered scraping framework built to collect, normalize, and store data relevant to low-income and homeless individuals across the Lower Mainland (BC, Canada). The goal is to build the most comprehensive, real-time database of resources available to someone in crisis ‚Äî including food programs, shelter availability, hygiene services, public internet, and more.

This project will aggregate data from a wide variety of sources:
- Public websites (via HTML scraping)
- PDF documents (using PDF parsers)
- Open APIs (from municipal, nonprofit, and health organizations)

All harvested data is funneled into a clean, unified format and stored in a PostgreSQL database. From there, it can be exposed via API to support projects like [Street Ninja](https://streetninja.ca) and other community-led initiatives.


### Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: NestJS (modular architecture)
- **Scraping Tools**: Playwright, Cheerio, Axios, pdf-parse
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
- **Job Queue**: BullMQ (Redis-backed async scraping jobs)
